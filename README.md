# Qwik Style Guide

Coding style guides are usually written after years of experience, lessons learned and feedback from real and big projects using a specific technology.

[Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) is a new and revolutionary framework and because of that, many best practices are still being discovered as more Qwik apps are being built.

This guide is meant to serve as an ever evolving document, where best practices are being suggested, debated and added by Qwik community members.

The aim is to potentially "graduate" the most popular / agreed upon rules into the official Qwik docs and / or as rules for the Qwik ESLint plugin.
